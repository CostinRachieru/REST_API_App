				Homework 2 - Web Client - REST API Comunication                

	The client works the following way:
	-> Reads a command from stdin.
	-> Checks if it is a valid command and if it can be done in that moment (ex:
	you can not logout if you never logged in).
	-> Asks for more input (if necessary) and parses it.
	-> Creates the message to be sent to the server.
	-> Opens a connection to the server (it is opened now because that way I
	am sure the connection is up).
	-> Sends message to the server.
	-> Gets a response from the server.
	-> Searches for errors in the response from the server
	-> Saves the changes that might have to be done (saves cookie / token).
	-> Prints the error if there is one, otherwise prints a success message or
	the information received.
	-> Closes the connection to the server.
	-> Waits for another input from stdin.

	Some edge cases:
	-> You will need to be logged out if you want to login with another account.
	-> The logout action can receive an error from the server (if the cookie
	expires) that says you were not logged in. I chose not to show it in the
	user interface. Instead I showed that everything is allright (which is true)
	and the user can log in again in any account after that.
	-> you can not anything with books if you did not enter the library first.
	-> you can not enter the library if you did not login first.
	-> you can not logout if you did not login first.
	-> The enter_library command can be a fail if the cookie is expired. I chose
	to approach this problem by telling the user he needs to log in again. That
	way he will not be able to do anything untill he logs in again, even if he
	had already had a valid token. He will need to get cookie and token again.

		I chose not to use a dedicated library for parsing a JSON. It was simple
	enough to do the parsing by myself.
		In chose to use C++ because at the beginning I thought I will need some
	data structures from STL, but in the end I did not use any.

		I tested the homework with Valgrind and I could not find any memory leaks
	and errors.
